# Hello there! I'm Charlie. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a product designer with experience in UX/UI design (wireframes, prototypes, design systems, information architecture and more). I've also led multi-disciplinary teams and worked closely with key stakeholders and development teams to achieve desired outcomes.

When I'm not helping to build lovely digital experiences, you'll find me hiking in nature or playing video games ðŸŽ®.

I love what I do, and I'm always open to collaborating with teams who want to innovate in their spaceâ€”whether that's across e-learning, B2B services, video games, or anything in-between.
